* Introduction
This repository contains code for test, as well as some documentation
on test results, related to Common Lisp compliance of the [[https://github.com/euslisp/EusLisp][EusLisp]]
language.

Those tests are based on the [[https://common-lisp.net/project/ansi-test/][Ansi-Test]] test suite, which was made to
test the Common Lisp compliance of different Common Lisp implementations.

To run the tests (assuming you have installed ~euslisp~, perhaps with the ~irt~ extension), issue either ~roseus eus-test.l~, ~irteusgl
eus-test.l~, (perhaps) ~eus eus-test.l~ or ~./eus-test.l~ (assuming the file has execution
permissions).

In order to get precise coverage of the tests (so as to have
an idea of how much "Common" is EusLisp), you might want to visit the
file ~reports/REPORT.org~. In order to update the tests documentation,
after running them, you might want to visit ~reports/update-report.py~
and follow the instructions.

It follows a brief description on some of the compliance-related (options with an "*[X]*"
are meant as solved) issues, as well as a coarse log on the tests coverage.

* USAGE
****** These .org files are intended to be used with the emacs text editor.
****** In order to FOLD or UNFOLD a list or sublist, use TAB.
****** SHIFT TAB folds/unfolds whole levels.
****** In border to change the state of a task, use C-c C-t.
****** In order to toggle the state of a checklist, use C-c on the checklist.
****** In order to update statistics on the whole file (useful after an automatic update on REPORTS.org), use C-u C-c #.
****** In order to kill an entire subtree, use C-c C-x C-w
****** If you use linum for line numbers, you might want to either disable them, or disable them for org-mode only:
******  one option for that is to add [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/linum-off.el][this]] file to your .emacs.d and then (require 'linum-off) to your init.el
****** In order to update REPORT.org, please check update-report.py.

* Milestones
** CURRENT 1 - Multiple values
   -  Pass multiple-values tests mostly
     - See data-and-control-flow folder, multiple-value* tests
   - [X] Fix changes that were made in order to be able to run the tests.
     Depends upon a few functions update to return multiple values (postponed), as well as in the ability to print multiple values (postponed).
*** Caveats:
   - In sum, what was added is a modest implementation of multiple values, different from the one present in ~common.l~.
   -  It has a few important differences from the common lisp specification, namely that
      1. it doesn't supply nil values when needed;
      2. it doesn't silently discard exceeding values when required (note that this point, along with the previous one,
         makes this implementation notably less flexible with respect to multiple values);
      3. the rules regarding the passing of multiple values were largely overlooked.
   - However, if a function is defined to return multiple values but is called without the multiple-value apparatus
     (that is, outside of functions or macros built with multiple-value-call), it returns only one value.
     This was thought so that operations like (setq a (floor 4 5)), for instance, which are constantly used,
     wouldn't yield too weird results (or oblige us to keep them single-valued).
   - Another important point is that not all common lisp functions defined as working with multiple values were updated.
     For that reason, prog1 might return multiple values, for instance.
     It seems to be more practical to update each one upon testing its set (so, for instance, update number related
     functions when testing numbers) than to try to do all at once.
   - This implementation might deserve to be rethought at some time.

** TODO 2 - Environment tests
   - Pass Environment tests
    - Check out environment folder

** WAITING 3 - Package tests
   - [-] Pass packages tests
     -  Implement parse-def-macro
     -  //        destructuring-bind
     - [X] //        defpackage

** CURRENT 4 Arrays
   - Solve "Symbol expected in (symbol-value type)"
   - Define undefined functions/macros (see below for examples)
   - Think about what can be done about the other issues :)
*** Caveats
    - symbol-value cannot retrieve values from lexical (local) variables.
    - "Symbol expected in (symbol-value type)" (should demand a few changes)
    - (seemingly) scope issues ("unbound variable in ...")
    - The fact that the such as #\x turn into numbers raises some errors
    - The lack of the such as #0ax crashes the tests

      - fixnum
      - array-total-size-limit
